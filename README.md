This is a **Film Management System** built with SQL. The database contains 7 interconnected tables: `Films`, `Directors`, `Genres`, `Users`, `Actors`, `Film_Actors`, and `Reviews`. It demonstrates proper use of foreign keys, normalization, and JOIN queries. The system supports tracking movie metadata, directors, genres, user reviews, and cast information. Ideal for learning relational database design and SQL operations like inserting, querying, and managing dependencies.
